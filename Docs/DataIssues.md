1) Class capacity is not right...some classes have '0' capacity, throwing off 'remaining' fields as negative
2) Some classes did not have meeting times or location
3) Not all catalog data is available in CSV format
4) Inconsistency in "fee" field...data needs massive massaging before use
5) Size of db and DW led to issues pushing and pull to/from GitHub and JupyterLab
